### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Schuyler(sky-ler). I've spent the last decade working in restraunts with the seedy underbelly of society (bartenders). Now instead of slinging drinks I sling code. 
Looking forward to integrating my soft skills that have proven to drive workflow efficiency, increase sales revenue, and facilitate team goal accomplishments into my next tech focused role. Recently, I have contributed to interactive small business applications and digital task management tools using React, Bootstrap, Redux, HTML, and SQLite3. I am currently, exploring my next projects to support a non-profit entity by consulting with developer teams and stakeholders to identity website optimized feature requests, coordinate tasks within an agile environment, and plan to deliver on task objectives within 1-2 weeks. Feel free to review my posted projects and connect with me if you have any Software Engineering or Web Development career opportunities we could discuss!
